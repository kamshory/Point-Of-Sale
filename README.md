# Point-Of-Sale

A **Point of Sale (POS)** system represents the time and place where a retail transaction occurs. At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the total amount owed by the customer, presents the bill, and offers various payment options. Once the payment is made, a receipt can be issued either on paper or electronically.

The POS system may integrate several devices such as:
- **Barcode Scanners** to read product codes.
- **Weighing Scales** for bulk or produce items.
- **Cash Registers and Receipt Printers** for billing.
- **Touch Screens and Payment Terminals** for customer interaction and transaction finalization.

This repository contains the source files, database schemas, and supporting tools for building a modern, cross-database POS application using **MagicAppBuilder**.
